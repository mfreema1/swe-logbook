Continuing work on the Pandr application on AWS.  Most of the authentication logic has been implemented via Cognito, which is probably one of my favorite services on the AWS platform as of yet.  It just seems to make that whole process so easy to integrate.  I also like that you can just sit it right on top of the API gateway and have it take care of most of that integration.  All of the endpoints and methods for daily entries are defined and users can be created/confirmed via API calls.  I just need to see about chaining together Lambda functions, passing event data between them, and deploying the API to test outside of the AWS harness.  Once that's done, I'll flesh out more of the API including weekly and monthly entries, but they'll follow pretty much the same pattern as the daily entries, so I'm holding off on that for now.  More to come soon!
