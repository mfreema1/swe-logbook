I'm officially starting the software engineering notebook up again on the recommendation of Prof. Vesonder.  I think it'll just be useful to keep track of my progress through things, but we'll see how it goes.  As far as my modern progress, right now I'm at Prudential as part of Enterprise Architecture, doing a ton of work with web architecture and API development.  I'm getting involved with cloud and currently studying for the CSD which is pretty exciting.  Oh and I finally finished my A+ certification which is cool.  Today was mostly spent working with lambda functions in AWS, viewing how they operate, what kinds of triggers can be accepted, and continuing to map out flow operations for the Pandr project I'm working on.  Also did some more work on that Cloud talk I'm going to do at the upcoming Venture Hacks which I can't wait to give, I think cloud is gonna be really big for the upcoming developers and is gonna be critical for the startups the students form.  More on this soon!
